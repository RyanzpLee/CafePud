# CafePud

CafePud is a coffee recipe app that you can use to create or explore recipes. Users can register an account to save personal recipes and start using them with a click of a button.

You'll be able to explore other recipes that users have shared, and you can tweak them to your liking. This should allow you to search for different recipes by their properties.

## Motivation

This webapp is created for my CS50 final project, and I chose to make this as I enjoy brewing coffee with niche methods as a hobby. I wanted to create a webapp that I could use and share to friends and let others do the same.

I've designed the website using Figma, and it's my first time doing so. I wanted to explore the digital design aspect and prototyping the UI/UX, and I believe I have learned a lot to creating a pleasing website design for the user. Although I still have a lot to learn in regards to this.

I have created a previous finance website using Python Flask for the back-end framework, however for this project I wanted to explore using Flask's blueprint method to allow for greater moduality and allow for easier integration of new features in the future.

I hope to implement more features that give users more interaction and increase the social aspect of the website.
